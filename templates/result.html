<h1>Beningn Keratosis</h1>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/demo-img1.png') }}" id="heatmap" alt="heatmap">
<p class="desc">It is a generic class that includes seborrheic ker- atoses ("senile wart"), solar lentigo - which can be
    regarded a
    flat variant of seborrheic keratosis - and lichen-planus like keratoses (LPLK), which corresponds to a seborrheic
    keratosis or a solar lentigo with inflammation and regression. The three subgroups may look different dermatoscop-
    ically, but we grouped them together because they are similar biologically and often reported under the same generic
    term histopathologically. From a dermatoscopic view, lichen planus-like keratoses are especially challeng- ing
    because they can show morphologic features mimicking melanoma and are often biopsied or excised for diagnostic
    reasons.</p>
